# 20+ Quranic Refutations of Hadith {style=text-align:center}

### 1. "Obeying the Messenger means following Hadith"

📌 Sunni Claim 1:
> Verses command obedience to the Messenger (e.g., 4:59), implying we must follow his reported sayings and actions in Hadith.

    ⚡ Qur’anic Refutation:   
    [7:35] O children of adam, when Messengers from among yourselves come to you, relating My Ayahs...”  
    [6:130]	“O assembly of Jinn and mankind, did there not come to you messengers from among you, relating to you My Ayahs…?”  
    [2:99] We have sent down Clear Ayahs to you and no one rejects them except the deviators.  
    
    🔍 Analysis:  
    The Qur’an defines the Messenger’s mission as *relating God's ayahs* — not offering private speech, nor personal commentary.
    
    Can you answer simple questions?
    ❓ Does obey the messenger mean i must obey you, your imams or hadith narrators dead or alive ?  
    A: Yes  
    B: No  
    C: Cognitive Dissonance  
    D: Diversion   
    E: Exit
    
    ❓ Are Hadith collections referred to anywhere as "ayahs"? 
    A: Yes  
    B: No  
    C: Cognitive Dissonance  
    D: Diversion   
    E: Exit

    ⚠️ Warning
    [22:52]	“We did not send before you any messenger or prophet but when he recited, Shaitaan interfered in his recitation. But Allah abolishes what throws the Shaitaan, then *Allah will establish His Ayahs.* And Allah (is) All-Knower, All-Wise.””

### 2. "The Prophet explains the Qur’an via Hadith"

📌 Sunni Claim 2:
> “We have sent down to you the reminder that you may explain (tubayyina) what was sent down to you...” (Qur’an 16:44)
> The Qur’an states the Prophet explains it (16:44), necessitating Hadith for understanding.

    
    ⚡ Qur’anic Refutation:  
    [12:1] "These are the verses of the clear Book(kitab mubin)."  
    [16:89] "We have sent down the Book as an explanation(tibyan) for all things."   
    [2:159] Surely those who conceal the clear proofs(bayan) and the guidance that We revealed after We made it clear(bayanahu) in the Book for men, these it is whom Allah shall curse, and those who curse shall curse them (too)."   
    [41:3] “A Book whose verses are mufaṣṣal (detailed), an Arabic Qur’an for a people who know.”
    
    🔍 Analysis:  
    16:44 does not say the Prophet was sent to interpret or create independent commentary.
    The verb “tubayyina” also means “to deliver clearly, to convey transparently, to make accessible”, not to interpret subjectively.
    The Qur'an is Self-Explanatory (No Need for External Hadith) 
    The Prophet’s explanation is confined to the Qur’an itself.  
    The Qur’an is mufaṣṣal (detailed) and does not require external explanations.  
    Hadith is not mentioned or sanctioned as a source of explanation.

    Allah Alone, Quran Only see 60.4, 40.12, 40.84, 39.45, 17.46, 5.54

### 3. "Hadith provides ritual details missing in the Qur’an"

📌 Sunni Claim 3: 
> The Qur’an lacks specifics for practices like salah; Hadith fills these gaps.

    ⚡ Qur’anic Refutation  
    [6:38] And there is no creature on [or within] the earth or bird that flies with its wings except [that they are] communities like you. *We have not neglected in the book a thing.* then unto their Sustainer they will be gathered.  
    [6:39] *But those who deny Our AYAHS are deaf and dumb within darknesses.* Whomever Allah wills - He leaves astray; and whomever He wills - He puts him on a straight path.
    
    “...We have not neglected anything from the Book.”  
    
    This is explicit: The Qur’an is complete in its guidance.   
    It does not require hadith literature to “complete” it.  
    If God says nothing is left out, then to claim "details" are missing is to challenge that very statement.  
    
    Perhaps the explanation for your inability to locate the "details" in the Quran is provided below:
    
    [6:46] Say: Have you considered that If Allah took away your hearing and your sight and sealed up your hearts, what god is there, other than Allah, who could give them back to you?´ Look how We vary the Signs, yet still they turn away!
    
    [17:46] We place veils over their hearts to prevent them from understanding it and deafness in their ears, and *when you commemorate(ذَكَرْتَ) your Sustainer(رَبَّكَ) in(فِي) the Quran(الْقُرْآنِ) Alone(وَحْدَهُ) they turn their backs and run away in aversion.
    
    * This verse highlights a *deep aversion to Tawheed (absolute oneness)* and to reliance *only* on the Qur’an.
    * The cause of rejection is not misunderstanding Arabic, but discomfort with the *exclusive authority of the Qur’an*.
    * The word *وَحْدَهُ (alone)* is key: those who insist on other authorities (traditions, scholars, hadith, etc.) cannot tolerate the Qur’an on its own terms.
    
    If you can't find it in the Quran it's not part of Islam, simple.
    
    🔍 Analysis:  
    The Qur’an provides the essential framework for salah (connection) without needing Hadith.  
    Details are principles-based, not ritualistic checklists.  
    The focus is on the root meaning of salah as a connection, not a ritual.

    ⚠️ Warning    
    [47:24] Then do they not reflect upon the Qur'an, or are there locks upon [their] hearts?
    [47:25] Those who turn back as apostates after The Guidance *<al-huda>* Is made clear *<tabayyina>* – the shaitaan has instigated them and busied them up with false hopes”

### 4. "Following the Prophet means following Hadith"

📌 Sunni Claim 4:
> 3:31 commands loving Allah and following the Prophet, implying Hadith adherence.

    ⚡ Qur’anic Refutation:  
    [6:155] And this is a Book We have sent down and blessed, so follow it and have taqwa so that hopefully you will gain mercy.    
    [7:3] “Follow what has been revealed to you from your Sustainer.”  
    
    🔍 Analysis:  
    Following the Prophet means adhering to the Qur’an he delivered.  
    The Qur’an does not endorse Hadith as a source of guidance.  
    Love for Allah is tied to following the revealed Book.
    
    ⚠️ Warning
    [42:21] They follow authorities 'shuraka' *(idols \ imams, sheikhs \ muftis \ hadith narrators dead/alive) who decree for them laws in their deen that were never authorised by God.* If it were not for a decision consistent with His ordinance, they would have been judged immediately. Indeed, the transgressors have incurred a painful retribution.
    
    ❓ Does follow the messenger mean i must oollow you, your imams or hadith narrators dead or alive ?  
    A: Yes  
    B: No  
    C: Cognitive Dissonance  
    D: Diversion

### 5. "Kitab and Hikmah refer to Qur’an and Hadith(sunnah)"

📌 Sunni Claim 5:
Ḥikmah in 2:129 refers to Hadith as a secondary revelation.

    ⚡ Qur’anic Refutation:  
    [10:1] “These are the verses of the wise Book.”  
    [54:5] A perfect(بَالِغَةٌ) wisdom(حِكْمَةٌ); but the(فَمَا) warnings(النُّذُرُ) are of no benefit.  
    [44:4] In it(فِيهَا), is a decree(يُفْرَقُ) for every(كُلُّ) matter(أَمْرٍ) of wisdom(حَكِيمٍ).
    
    🔍 Analysis:  
    Ḥikmah (wisdom) is intrinsic to the Qur’an, not a separate source.   
    The Qur’an is described as ḥakīm (wise), negating the need for external sources like Hadith.

    Allah Alone, Quran Only see 60.4, 40.12, 40.84, 39.45, 17.46, 5.54

### 6. "Hadith is revelation (Wahy Ghayr Matluw)"

📌 Sunni Claim 6:
> The Prophet received non-recited revelation (Hadith).

    ⚡ Qur’anic Refutation:  
    [6:19] Say, *"What thing is the greatest testimony?"* Say, "God is witness* between me and you that *this Quran has been Wahy(revealed) to me* to warn you with it and whomever it reaches...""  
    [53:4] It is but a وَحْيٌ revelation being revealed.
        
    🔍 Analysis:  
    Only the Qur’an is identified as wahy (revelation).   
    The Prophet’s role is to deliver the Qur’an, not additional revelations. 
    
    Hadith is not mentioned as a form of revelation.
    
    ⚠️ Warning
    Devils Also Inspire (Yūḥūna) False Speech  
    [6:112] And thus We have made for every prophet an enemy - shaitans from mankind and jinn, inspiring to one another decorative speech in delusion. But if your Sustainer had willed, they would not have done it, so leave them and that which they invent.  
    The term "wahy" is not exclusive to divine revelation - proving 53:3-4 must refer only to Quran.  
    
    Allah Alone, Quran Only see 60.4, 40.12, 40.84, 39.45, 17.46, 5.54

### 7. "59:7 commands taking what the Messenger gives, including Hadith"

📌 Sunni Claim 7:
> “Take what the Messenger gives you” includes Hadith.

    ⚡ Qur’anic Refutation:  
    [59:7] whatever spoils (fai) God has assigned to His Messenger from the inhabitants of the town is for God and for the Messenger and for his kinsfolk and for orphans and the needy and the wayfarer, *so that they may not become the property of those of you who are rich.* Whatever the Messenger gives you, take it; and whatever he forbids you, abstain from it. Fear God; surely, God is severe in retribution.
    
    🔍 Analysis:  
    The context is the distribution of spoils(fai), nothing to do with Hadith or Sunnah.  
    The Messenger’s role is limited to delivering the Qur’an, not legislating or interpreting through Hadith.
    
    Allah Alone, Quran Only see 60.4, 40.12, 40.84, 39.45, 17.46, 5.54

### 8. "Rejecting Hadith means replacing it with opinion"

📌 Sunni Claim 8:
> Without Hadith, interpretation becomes subjective.

    ⚡ Qur’anic Refutation:  
    [10:36] *Most of them only follow conjecture.* while conjecture does not avail against the truth in anything. God is aware of what they do.  
    [10:66] Certainly, to God belongs all who are in the heavens and those who are on Earth. As for those who call on partners besides God, *they only follow conjecture, and they only guess.*  
    [6:116] If you obeyed most of those on earth, they would misguide you from Allah´s way. *they follow nothing but conjecture, they are only guessing.*   
    [2:2] “This is the Book about which there is no doubt, a guidance for those  conscious of Allah.”
    
    🔍 Analysis:  
    The Qur’an is clear and consistent, providing objective guidance.  
    Subjective opinions are irrelevant when the Qur’an is followed as the sole criterion.

### 9. "The Qur’an is too general; Hadith provides details"

📌 Sunni Claim 9:
> The Qur’an lacks specifics, requiring Hadith for practical application.

    ⚡ Qur’anic Refutation:  
    [16:89] “And We have sent down to you the Book as clarification for all things.” 
    [6:38] "We have neglected *nothing* in the Book."   
    [6:115] "The Word of your Sustainer is *complete* in truth and justice."   
    [29:51] Is it not enough/sufficient for them that We have sent down to you the Book which is recited to them? There is certainly a mercy and reminder in that for people who have iman.  
    
    🔍 Analysis:  
    The Qur’an is mufaṣṣal (detailed), sufficient, complete and does not require external details.  
    It provides comprehensive guidance for all matters of life.

### 10. "Hadith is preserved by God like the Qur’an"

📌 Sunni Claim 10:
> God’s preservation extends to Hadith.

    ⚡ Qur’anic Refutation:  
    [15:9] “Indeed, it is We who sent down the reminder, and indeed, We will be its guardian.”   
    [41:42] “Falsehood cannot approach it from before it or from behind it.” 
    
    🔍 Analysis:  
    Divine preservation is exclusively promised for the Qur’an.  
    Hadith is not mentioned as preserved, making it unreliable as a source of guidance.

    Allah Alone, Quran Only see 60.4, 40.12, 40.84, 39.45, 17.46, 5.54

### 11. "The Prophet had legal authority beyond the Qur’an"

📌 Sunni Claim 11:
> The Prophet legislated independently of the Qur’an.

    ⚡ Qur’anic Refutation:  
    [5:44] ...therefore fear not the people and fear Me, and Do not take a small price for my ayas; and *whoever did not judge by what Allah revealed, those are they that are the kafir.* 
    [5:45] ...And whoever does not judge(يَحْكُمْ) by what Allah has revealed(أَنزَلَ اللَّهُ)  then it is those who are the wrongdoers.  
    [5:47] ...And whoever does not judge(يَحْكُم) by what Allah revealed(أَنزَلَ اللَّهُ), those are they that are the transgressors.”  
    [5:49] “And judge between them by what Allah has revealed.” 
    [5:50] “Then is it the judgment of ignorance they desire? But who is better than Allah in judgment for a people who are certain?”
    [18:26] “He does not make any one his associate in His ‘hukm’ (laws and ruling).”

    🔍 Analysis:  
    The Prophet judged by revelation, not personal opinion.  
    The Qur’an is the sole source of legal authority, negating the need for Hadith-based rulings.

---  

### 12. "Early Muslims followed Hadith, proving its validity"

📌 Sunni Claim 12:
> The practice of early Muslims validates Hadith.

    ⚡ Qur’anic Refutation:  
    [6:155] This is a blessed book we have revealed. *so follow it* and be mindful 'of Allah', so you may be shown mercy.  
    [2:170] “And when it is said to them, follow what Allah has revealed, they say, rather, we will follow that which we found our fathers doing.” 
    
    🔍 Analysis:
    The word *“follow it”* leaves no space for additional sources such as man-made hadith collections.  
    Following ancestors is not a valid argument.  
    The Qur’an commands following only what is revealed, not traditions or practices of early Muslims.

--- 

### 13. "Rejecting Hadith means rejecting the Prophet"

📌 Sunni Claim 13:  
> Hadith is the Prophet’s Sunnah; rejecting it means rejecting him.

    ⚡ Qur’anic Refutation: 
    [17:77] Such was Our Sunnah with the messengers We sent before you, and you will find no change in Our Sunnah.
    [33:38] There is no blame on the prophet in doing anything that Allah has decreed upon him. Such was Allah's Sunnah with the people of old. And Allah's command is a determined duty.
    [48:23] Such was Allah's Sunnah in the past and you will find no change in Allah's Sunnah.
    [35:43] *...You will find that Allah's Sunnah is unchangeable; You will find that Allah's Sunnah is unalterable.*
    [35:62] *...there is no substitute for Allah's Sunnah*
    
    🔍 Analysis:
    "Sunnah" in Quran Refers ONLY to Allah's System - Not the Prophet    
    The Quran always uses "Sunnah" for Allah's unchanging system - never for the Prophet's actions.  
    Rejecting Hadith does not equate to rejecting the Prophet, as his mission was confined to the Qur’an.

--- 

### 14. "Isnad (chains) prove Hadith authenticity"

📌 Sunni Claim 14:
> Hadith chains (isnād) ensure authenticity.

    ⚡ Qur’anic Refutation:  
    [17:36] “And do not pursue that of which you have no knowledge...”   
    [45:24] “And they have no knowledge of it. They follow not except assumption.” 
    
    🔍 Analysis:    
    Isnād is conjecture (ẓann)—the Qur’an rejects guesswork (53:28).  
    Hadīth science relies on majority opinion, yet the Qur’an warns the majority is often wrong (6:116).  
    Only the Qur’an is preserved (15:9. Hadīth has no divine guarantee.
    Fabrications exist even in "authentic" Hadīth, proving Isnād is fallible.

---  

### 15. "Hadith fills gaps in the Qur’an"

📌 Sunni Claim 15:
> The Qur’an is incomplete without Hadith.

    ⚡ Qur’anic Refutation:  
    [6:38] “Nothing have We omitted from the Book.”  
    “And We have sent down to you the Book as clarification for all things.”   
    [29:51] Is it not enough/sufficient for them that We have sent down to you the Book which is recited to them? There is certainly a mercy and reminder in that for people who have iman.  
    
    🔍 Analysis:  
    The Qur’an is complete and detailed.  
    Hadith is unnecessary as the Qur’an addresses all aspects of guidance without omission.

---  

### 16. "Sunnah is revelation like the Qur’an"

📌 Sunni Claim 16:
> The Prophet’s Sunnah is a form of revelation.

    ⚡ Qur’anic Refutation:  
    [6:19] Say, *"What thing is the greatest testimony?"* Say, "God is witness* between me and you *that this Quran has been revealed to me (أُوحِيَ إِلَيَّ هَٰذَا الْقُرْآنُ)* to warn you with it and whomever it reaches. Do you bear witness that there are other gods besides God?" Say, "I do not bear witness”. Say, "He is but one God and I am innocent of the shirk which you commit."    
    [53:4] It is but a wahy (revelation) being revealed.
    
    🔍 Analysis:  
    Only the Qur’an is identified as revelation.  
    The Sunnah, as depicted in Hadith, is not mentioned or endorsed as a source of divine guidance.

---  

### 17. "The Prophet judged beyond the Qur’an"

📌 Sunni Claim 17:
> The Prophet made rulings not found in the Qur’an.

    ⚡ Qur’anic Refutation:  
    [5:49] “...And judge between them by what Allah has revealed.”  
    [5:50] “...Then is it the judgment of ignorance they desire? But who is better than Allah in judgment for a people who are certain?”  
    [12:40] “Surely the ‘HUKM’(الْحُكْمُ) (law and rule) is for none but Allah.” he has ordered you to serve him alone; such is the established deen, even though most men do not realize it. 
    
    🔍 Analysis:  
    The Prophet’s judgments were based on revelation.  
    The Qur’an does not sanction extra-Qur’anic rulings, making Hadith-based judgments invalid.

---  

### 18. "Scholarly consensus validates Hadith"

📌 Sunni Claim 18:
> Majority scholarly agreement proves Hadith’s authenticity.

    ⚡ Qur’anic Refutation:  
    [6:116] “And if you obey most of those upon the earth, they will mislead you from the way of Allah.”
    [10:36] “Most of them follow nothing but assumptions, but assumptions can be of no value at all against the Truth: God is well aware of what they do.”
    
    🔍 Analysis:  
    Majority consensus is not a criterion for truth.  
    The Qur’an warns against following the majority, emphasizing adherence to revelation alone.

---  

### 19. "Qur’an preserved by Hadith scholars"

📌 Sunni Claim 19:
> Hadith scholars preserved the Qur’an.

    ⚡ Qur’anic Refutation:  
    [15:9] “Indeed, it is We who sent down the reminder, and indeed, We will be its guardian.”  
    [41:42] “Falsehood cannot approach it from before it or from behind it.” 
    
    🔍 Analysis:  
    Allah preserves the Qur’an, not scholars.  
    Hadith scholars are not mentioned or credited with the Qur’an’s preservation.

### 20. "The Messenger is a good example  (usswaton hasana)..." 33:21

📌 *Sunni Claim:*
> "Surely there was a good example (usswaton hasana) for you in the Messenger of Allah..., (33:21) the good example is recorded in the Hadiths."

    ⚡ Qur’anic Refutation:  
    [33:21] "There has certainly been in the Messenger of Allah a good example (usswaton hasana) for those who hope for Allah and the Last Day and remember Allah often."
    
    🔍 Analysis:
    The good example (usswaton hasana) mentioned in 33:21 is specifically about the Messenger's constant remembrance of God and seeking the Last Day.   
    It does not extend to trivial matters such as how to eat, which foot to use to enter the toilet, which side to sleep on, or how to urinate.  
    These details are not mentioned in the Qur’an and are not part of the good example set by the Messenger.
    
    *Further Evidence:*
    The same phrase "usswaton hasana" (good example) is used in 60:4 and 60:6 in connection with Abraham and those with him.
    
    [60:4] "There has been a good example (usswaton hasana) set for you by Abraham and those with him, when they said to their people: 'We are innocent from you and what you serve besides God. We have rejected you (kafarna bikum), and it appears that there shall be animosity and hatred between us and you until you believe in God alone...'"
    
    🔍 Analysis:
    The good example set by Abraham and those with him is about their rejection of idolatry and their commitment to serving God alone. This further emphasizes that the good example is about spiritual and moral conduct, not about trivial daily practices.  

    ❓ Is the good example (uswaton hasana) in the Messenger about trivial daily practices?  
    A: Yes  
    B: No  
    C: Cognitive Dissonance  
    D: Diversion   
    E: Exit

*Summary:*

| Claim (Idea) | Qur’anic Refutation | Key Verse | Conclusion |
|--------------|---------------------|-----------|------------|
| The Messenger is a good example (usswaton hasana) | The good example lies in constant remembrance of God and seeking the Last Day | 33:21, 60:4 | Allah Alone, Qur’an Only (39:45) |

---

*Conclusion*
The Qur’an is clear, complete, and fully detailed, and the Messenger’s role is limited to delivering the message. The good example (usswaton hasana) set by the Messenger and others like Abraham is about spiritual and moral conduct, not about trivial daily practices. The Qur’an emphasizes individual responsibility for understanding and does not delegate legislative or explanatory roles beyond itself.

### 21. "Islam is impractical without Hadith"


> 📌 Sunni Claim: 
> The Qur’an alone is insufficient for practical guidance.

    ⚡ Qur’anic Refutation:  
    [29:51] Is it not enough/sufficient for them that We have sent down to you the Book which is recited to them? There is certainly a mercy and reminder in that for people who have iman.  
    [5:3] “This day I have perfected for you your deen and completed My favor upon you...”
    [16:89] “...And We have sent down to you the Book as clarification for all things.” 
    
    🔍 Analysis:  
    The Qur’an is complete and practical.  
    Hadith is unnecessary as the Qur’an provides comprehensive guidance for all aspects of life.

### 22: "How do you pray if you reject the Hadith? The Qur’an doesn’t show you how to pray!"

📌 *Sunni Claim:*
> “How do you pray if you reject the Hadith? The Qur’an doesn’t show you how to pray!”

    ⚡ Qur’anic Refutation:  
    The term "dua" (supplication) is used in the Qur’an to describe prayer. Let’s examine how people prayed (dua) in the Qur’an:
    
    - *Zechariah’s Prayer:* "He said, 'My Sustainer, appoint for me a sign.' He said, 'Your sign is that you will not speak to the people for three days, except by gesture. And remember your Sustainer frequently and exalt Him with praise in the evening and the morning.'" (Qur’an 3:38)
    - *Abraham’s Prayer:* "And Abraham prayed, 'My Sustainer, make this a secure city and provide its people with fruits, such of them as believe in God and the Last Day.'" (Qur’an 14:40)
    - *General Prayers:*
      - "Say: 'O God, Master of the Kingdom, You give the kingdom to whom You will, and You take away the kingdom from whom You will. You exalt whom You will, and You humble whom You will. In Your hand is all good. Verily, You have power over all things.'" (Qur’an 3:26)
      - "Say: 'O God, Bestower of Mercy, Your Mercy which encompasses all things, bestow Your Mercy on us.'" (Qur’an 7:156)

> How did you get the Qur’an?

    ⚡ Qur’anic Refutation:  
    [35:32] "And We have given the Book for inheritance, to those of Our servants as We chose, there are among them, some who wrong their own souls, some who follow a middle course, and some who are, by God's permission, foremost in good deeds."

---

*Conclusion*
The Qur’an is clear, complete, and fully detailed, and the Messenger’s role is limited to delivering the message. The Qur’an emphasizes individual responsibility for understanding and does not delegate legislative or explanatory roles beyond itself.

---

Here is a *Qur’an-only, historically grounded, and intellectually consistent rebuttal* to the Sunni claim that:

> "Qur’an-only Muslims are a modern deviation (19th–20th century), and the Hadith was always accepted by the ummah since the Prophet's time."

---

## ❌ Claim Breakdown:

1. *Qur’an-only belief is new (19th–20th century)*
2. *Hadith rejection is a result of Western colonization*
3. *The ummah has always accepted Hadith + Qur’an together*
4. *Only mainstream Muslims are the true followers of Islam*
5. *Rejecting Hadith is rejecting the Prophet ﷺ*

---

## ✅ Rebuttal with Qur’an & Early History

---

### 🔹 *1. Qur’anists existed long before modern times — even in Imam al-Shāfiʿī’s day*

📚 In *Imam al-Shāfiʿī’s own book*, *Jimaʿ al-ʿIlm* (The Consolidation of Knowledge), he debates with a man who:

* Accepts only the *Qur’an* as authority
* Rejects Hadith as legal or theological evidence
* Insists the Prophet is to be obeyed *only through revelation*, not personal speech
* Uses the *same verses* as modern Qur’an-only Muslims:

  * 6:114 – *“Shall I seek other than Allah as judge?”*
  * 6:19 – *“This Qur’an has been revealed to me to warn you by it and whomever it reaches.”*

📌 *This shows Qur’an-only reasoning existed in the 8th–9th century*, even acknowledged by scholars of Hadith.

> ✅ *Qur’an-only Islam is not new. It simply never became institutionalized due to state and scholarly suppression.*

---

### 🔹 *2. Qur’an-only Islam is not Western — it’s Qur’anic*

* The claim that Qur’an-centric thinking is a Western invention is ironic.
* *The Qur’an commands us to follow it alone*:

> *“This \[Qur’an] is a clarification of all things… so follow it.”*
> — *16:89*

> *“In what hadith after it will they believe?”*
> — *45:6*

> *“We did not leave anything out of the Book.”*
> — *6:38*

* *Following Allah alone* is not Western — it’s *tawheed*.

---

### 🔹 *3. The Ummah has always been divided — unity ≠ truth*

* *Sunni Islam itself formed over 200 years after the Prophet*, through:

  * Political alliances
  * Legal schools (madhabs)
  * Selective canonization of hadith

* The idea of a *unified “mainstream Islam”* is historical revisionism.

> *“If you follow the majority on earth, they will mislead you from Allah’s path…”*
> — *6:116*

> ✅ *Truth is not defined by majority consensus or tradition.*

---

### 🔹 *4. Hadith is not needed to explain the Qur’an — the Qur’an explains itself*

> *“And We have certainly made the Qur’an easy to remember — so is there any who will remember?”*
> — *54:17*

> *“And We have sent down to you the Book as a clarification of all things...”*
> — *16:89*

The *Qur’an does not direct us to any secondary explanation* or narrator.
It challenges you to *reflect* — not to obey external interpretations blindly.

---

### 🔹 *5. Equating Hadith with the Prophet ﷺ is false*

* The *Qur’an does not say "obey Hadith"* — it says:

> *“Obey the Messenger” — and the Messenger said:
> *‘I follow only what is revealed to me.’*
> — *6:50*

* The *Messenger delivers revelation* — he is not a parallel source of divine law.

> *“Your duty is only to convey the message.”*
> — *42:48*

> ✅ Obeying the Prophet = Obeying the Qur’an
> Not = Obeying narrators, compilers, or sectarian collections.

### 🧠 Summary of the Refutation

| *Sunni Claim*                              | *Qur’an-Centric Rebuttal*                              |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Qur’anists are a modern cult                 | Found in early centuries, debated by Imam al-Shāfiʿī     |
| Hadith needed to understand the Qur’an       | Qur’an explains itself — 16:89, 6:114                    |
| Rejecting Hadith = Rejecting Prophet         | Messenger only delivers revelation — 6:19, 42:48         |
| Unity proves truth (majority follows Hadith) | Majority can mislead — 6:116                             |
| Hadith = explanation of Qur’an               | Qur’an says *it is the clarification* — 12:111, 16:89    |
| Without Hadith, Islam is incomplete          | Qur’an: *Nothing is omitted* — 6:38                      |
| Qur’anists interpret based on desires        | Qur’an calls for reflection and sincerity — 47:24, 54:17 |

---

### 🛡 Final Note:

*No verse in the Qur’an commands you to follow Hadith. Not one.*
But the Qur’an repeatedly warns about taking other authorities besides Allah:

> *“Or do they have partners who legislate for them in the Deen what Allah has not authorized?”*
> — *42:21*

So ask sincerely:

> Are you following the Messenger ﷺ?
> Or the men who claimed to speak on his behalf centuries later?
